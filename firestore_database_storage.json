Cough can be dry and itchy or chesty and phlegmy. Benadryl cough syrup contains a combination of diphenhydramine, ammonium chloride and sodium citrate as active substances. It works by blocking the effects of allergic chemicals and providing relief from allergic symptoms such as a runny nose and watery eyes. This medicine also thins the mucous and makes it easier to cough out. Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Shake well before use. Use a measuring cup or spoon for the exact quantity. Do not consume directly from the bottle. Benadryl syrup should not be used for children below 4 years of age without medical advice. Do not consume more than the recommended dose and keep a gap of at least 4 hours between two consecutive doses. Do not take this medicine if you are allergic to any of its components. Before starting Benadryl cough syrup, inform the doctor if you are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding and about your complete medical history.
